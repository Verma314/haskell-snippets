-- we can try to sort it by 2nd name using:

-}
-- but this gives an error because Name is (String,String) which implements its own Ord



-- Alternative:
data NameV2 = NameV2 (String, String) deriving (Show, Eq)
-- here using the data constructor makes this new type different 

-- now that we have our custom type we can implement Ord 
-- (and also utilize the built in compare in String)
instance Ord NameV2 where
   compare (NameV2 (f1,l1)) (NameV2 (f2,l2)) = compare (l1,f1) (l2,f2)

-- now when we try to sort a list of NameVC this above Ord implementation will be invoked:

{-Note that Enum doesnâ€™t require either Ord or Eq, 
even though it maps types to Int values (which implement both Ord and Eq). 
Ignoring the fact that you can easily use deriving for Eq and Ord,
use the derived implementation of Enum to make manually defining Eq and Ord much easier.-}    
-- to solve the above implement Eq and Ord using the fromEnum method (to convert our value into num)

Q14.2

Define a five-sided die (FiveSidedDie type). 
Then define a type class named Die and at least one method that 
would be useful to have for a die. Also include superclasses you think make sense for a die. 
Finally, make your FiveSidedDie an instance of Die.

data FiveSidedDie = S1 | S2 | S3 | S4 | S5  deriving (Enum, Eq, Show) 
-- this deriving *needs* to be there because later we make FiveSidedDie an instance of type class Die
-- the type class Die itself has Eq and Enum as superclass
-- hence FiveSidedDie also needs to be able to implement Eq and Enum

    printSide :: a -> String
