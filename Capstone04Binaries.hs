{-
The first 5 bytes of the leader contain 
a number telling you the length of the record.

 To get the length of your entire record, 
 you need to take these first five characters 
 and then convert them to an Int type. 
 Youâ€™ll create a useful helper function, rawToInt, 
 which will safely convert your ByteString to Text, 
 then convert that Text to a String, and finally use read to parse an Int.
