-- You want to combine a first- and last-name string to create a personâ€™s name:
--  "Alan" ++ " " ++ "Turing".
-- The trouble is, both your first and last names are Maybe Strings
--  because they come from an unreliable source and might be missing. 

-- How can you combine these Strings and return a Maybe String for the name?

-- one way is: in which we are manually doing a lot of pattern matching.
-- but is there a better way?

Can we create an Applicative Type?

Okay fmap in functor is defined:
fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

example:
fmap (add) (Just 10) (Just 20)
...

What we want?
zmap :: Functor f => (a -> c -> d) -> f a -> f c -> f d
fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b     ) -> f a -> f b

-- create a function which 
b = c -> d

and 
f b = f c -> f d

to Concretize:

add = b  

Maybe add = 


nope,
