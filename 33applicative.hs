-- You want to combine a first- and last-name string to create a personâ€™s name:
--  "Alan" ++ " " ++ "Turing".
-- The trouble is, both your first and last names are Maybe Strings
--  because they come from an unreliable source and might be missing. 

-- How can you combine these Strings and return a Maybe String for the name?

-- one way is: in which we are manually doing a lot of pattern matching.
-- but is there a better way?
