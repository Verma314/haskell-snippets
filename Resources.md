* Typeclassopedia, which is part of the Haskell wiki (found at https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia)."

* to parallelize Haskell code. 
Read  Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell (O’Reilly Media, 2013), by Simon Marlow,

* Idris and Liquid Haskell, more powerful type system than haskell, 

* Manning has published a book on Idris by the creator of the language: 
Type-Driven Development with Idris by Edwin Brady (2017).

- Clojure : on jvm, has access to Java functions

-  Peter Seibel’s Practical Common Lisp (Apress, 2005), which is available free online: www.gigamonkeys.com/book/.


ML family of languages,

-  http://fsharp.org/.

-  Scala : on jvm
"probably your best bet if you’d like to do functional programming for a living"

- Elm (http://elm-lang.org/) and PureScript (www.purescript.org)
similar to Haskell can be compiled to JavaScript

"The Elm programming language is focused on creating JavaScript user interfaces using functional programming"

"PureScript is focused on making a Haskell-like language that compiles to JavaScript"

PureScript is very similar to Hasell in syntax.
